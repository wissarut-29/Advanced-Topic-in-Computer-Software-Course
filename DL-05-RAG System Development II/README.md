# DL-05-RAG System Development II

This project demonstrates 9 common problems in LLM and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. All simulations use the same real dataset, sex_q_a.txt, which is a Thai sexual health question-answer knowledge base. This allows each problem to be tested with real data instead of isolated sample data.

# Dataset:
The project uses one shared Knowledge Base containing Thai questions and answers about sexual health, consent, anatomy, and related laws.

The dataset contains 391 entries, covering 6 main categories and 3 language styles: formal, casual, and slang.

Each entry has three lines:
```text

[หมวด: <category>]
or
[หมวด: <category> | ภาษา: <variant>]

Q: <question>
A: <answer>

```
# Summary:

| # | Problem | Main Idea |
|---|---------|-----------|
| 1 | Hallucination | The LLM answers without supporting context. |
| 2 | Vocabulary Mismatch / Position | BoW cannot handle different wording or word order well. |
| 3 | Data Quality | Duplicate and noisy data reduce data quality. |
| 4 | Chunking | Poor chunk size or overlap can lose context. |
| 5 | Metadata Filtering | Similar content may have the wrong metadata. |
| 6 | Re-ranking | First-stage retrieval may rank the best document too low. |
| 7 | Faithfulness | Retrieval is correct, but generation changes important information. |
| 8 | RAG Configuration | Configuration controls which RAG components are active. |
| 9 | Evaluation | Measure chunking and retrieval with numerical metrics. |

All ten simulations use the same real Knowledge Base through `data_loader.py`. 
This allows different LLM and RAG problems to be tested using the same dataset and pipeline.
